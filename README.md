# WormTracker-NSnB

This is the software to control an assembled [openautoscope](https://bitbucket.org/natecermak/openautoscope/src/master/).  
The original software is written in LabView which costs almost as much as the scope itself.  
Oram, Ilana: The codes in Teensy are to control the motors (and LED). I will order the parts needed for that.
